# Charts {#charts}

ABARESdocs uses some Python scripts to generate nicely formated chart images. For more information on how this works see the charts folder.

Once chart image files and table text files have been generated they can be inserted as below. Pandoc supports numbering and cross-referencing of tables and charts.
